    "\n",
    "1. **Overview Fisrt**: In the most cases of big data visualization, it is good idea to provide overview to the audiences. We can provide such shape of the data or patterns that esily catches by boarder audience.\n",
    "![overview](images/overview.png)<br>\n",
    "2. **Zoom and Filter**: After look the overview, some audiences may interested in different detail. Provide zoom and filter feature may very useful for audience in order to exploration for specific goal. There is a problem when we zooming into specific area, sometime we just lost out of context. To prevent it, we may used extra features that provide **focus+context**. Tools such as zoom lens and fish eye lens may be very helpful. A very good demo of fish eye lens can be fount [here](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/fisheye/).\n",
    "3. **Detail on Demand**: May very helpful to provide audience supllement and annotation when user need it."

    "1. **Requirements Specification** is initial step in which we create formulation to guide system design. It may need to conduct some research in order to figuring out any problems and user needs. Some questions that may be useful to answer are:\n",

    "    * Who will the system serve?\n",
    "    * How will a user use the system to make a decision?\n",
    "2. **Architectural Design** is step in which we decompose the problem and the system into components, e.g. elements of a dashboard. Arhciteture in this term means high level abstraction rather than technical abstraction. In this step we may do brainstroming with sub devision, e.g. UI/UX dev, in order to decide best architecture.\n",
    "3. **Compenent Design** is step in which we planned how to execute arhitectural design technically. We may need to discuss with engineer team to decide apprpriate tool, possible visualization and interactions mechanism for each component.\n",
    "4. **Implementation** is step in which we actually implemented component design, such as coding or setup.\n",
    "5. **Component Testing** is step in which we do debugging.\n",
    "6. **User Evaluation** is step in which we do user testing to get feedback from real user and fnd any part need to be fixed. But, depend only on user's feedbak is not enough since there are will be some biases. So, consider to implement scientific method while collect data from user testing method, practical statistical method such as A/B testing is one widely used approach.\n",

For example, we may used prototype to simulate how a system might work with a user. A prototype may not to be complete system, it may a system which has many bugs. By let users try to use prototype, we may get fast feedback from users and capable to figuring out in which user interested.\n",
