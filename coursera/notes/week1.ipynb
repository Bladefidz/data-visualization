    "1. *Mathematical Visualization*: Based on mathematical equations. This visualization has been interested by mathematician since 1900, but they did not really understand about the dynamic of equation. We used computer to show or simulation the dynamic of mathematic equation. For example, we can plot a complex equation in very huge dimensions, then evaluate it into the smaller or higher dense to understand what visualization tell us about the dynamic.\n",

    "    **Missing data should be handle**.\n",
    "3. *Information Visualization*: Transform abstract data into more concreate visualization such as geometrical visualization, so we can easily interpreate the important information from the data.\n",

    "Recall from the basic of computer graphics: 2-D in computer graphipcs is all about **Rasterization**. The graphics representation that commonly used is **Vector Graphic**. Recall from basic geometry, we can do scaling to visualize our data into a smooth line. For example in, range of [1, 1], we can plot a 10 data points where each data is fraction of 10 (0, 1/10, 2/10, ..., 10/10). Although the vector graphics is widely used in practical visualization, when its come to computer we need to transform it onto raster graphics. **Raster graphic** is graphical representation by set of pixel in computer screen. Scaling in vector graphics might equalialence to pixel aliasing."

To represent a 3-D graphics, a computer need to do **3-D Graphics Pipeline** which is consisted by three ordered processing: Vertex processing, rasterization, and pixel processing. Before vertex processing, we already have an object contructed by triangles. In the vertex processing, we transform each triangle into a canvas. In the rasterization, we transform each outline into pixel. In pixel processing, we implement such algorithm to guess color for each pixel inside outline."

Some useful technique are: Occlusion, shadowing, illumination, perspective, and stereo. Occlusion is the strongest depth cue. Shadowing is occlusion of a light source. Illumination reveal surface orientation. Perspective can reveal different scales of visualization in addition to aiding depth perception. Stereo is useful when other cues are unavailable."

The main goal of non-photorealism is to reveal hidden information or find detail information from an object. For example: A realistic 3d object of hearth might be hide some details because some parts covered by blood, shadow, or placed in another direction. To reveal hidden information from the graphic of heart, an artist transform dark color into more lighter color, controling color variation, reveal hidden part and make outline stronger."

In induction process, we try to do extrapolation (prediction within continues axis) and interpolation (evaluation within descrete range) to infer information. In the induction reasoning, we may caution that correlation is not causation. Adbuction aimed to test our conclusion. In abduction process, we try to fit our model into real world simulation, so our model will be perfect to tell us the nature of fact. In the abduction reasoning, we may caution that our assumption and believe may be effected to our conclution, so that's why we need to reduce assumption as much as possible."
