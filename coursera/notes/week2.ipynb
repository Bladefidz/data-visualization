In the case of a database, we can maintenance relation between data as database indexes, so will increase retrieval time. After data storing problem being solved, we can do such optimization to enhance our storage. By doing data analysis, we can decide the quality of data we have collected. The task of data analysis included: inspecting, cleansing, and transforming. The goal of data analysis is reduced noise in our data collection, by removing or transforming. Another crucial optimization is data aggregation which has a significant impact on retrieval performance of our data collection. The task of data aggregation included: classification, clustering, etc.\n",

For example: If there are some missing data, then show them with less distraction as possible and making the visualization to make audience rely on reasoning to guess how missing data should be.\n",
    "2. Try to represent picture as information rather than text: Picture is great way to represent data because it has volume, area or length to indicate size, color to indicate differentiation and more. By using color, we can avoid miss-interpretaion.\n",

    "5. The Data-Ink Ratio: When it come to print in the paper, it is good idea to follow Tufte's minimalism which try to reduce color as much as possible.\n",
    "6. Micro/macro: When it came into detail, we prefer to see micro scales. But when it came it the overview, we prefer to see macro scales.\n",
    "7. Information layer: We need to inform audience about any information that can be exploited from visualization. For example: We may need to create different appearance as different elements such as color and shapes.\n",
    "8. Multiple: We need to stay consistent in order to represent some data in different cases. For example: We need to stay with exactly same chart and glyphs type when represent same measurement method on two different machince performance.\n",
