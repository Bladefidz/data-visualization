    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) to visualize dan analyze data. Tableau has easy navigation, for example, we can easily found a \"Show More\" button to choose proper graph to visualize correspondent data.\n",

    "## Data Visualization Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a framework to help us and simplify our understanding of how data visualization work. The **data visualization framework** can be seen in an image below:\n",

    "**Data Layer** contains two entities that are data sources and data collection. Before collecting all data, we need to do preprocessing that ensuring each data imported in the proper format. After data being imported, we need to ensure that all data stored in the best possible structure. In the case of a database, we can maintenance relation between data as database indexes, so will increase retrieval time. After data storing problem being solved, we can do such optimization to enhance our storage. By doing data analysis, we can decide the quality of data we have collected. The task of data analysis included: inspecting, cleansing, and transforming. The goal of data analysis is reduced noise in our data collection, by removing or transforming. Another crucial optimization is data aggregation which has a significant impact on retrieval performance of our data collection. The task of data aggregation included: classification, clustering, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mapping Layer** is a complicated layer which has robust implementation of linear algebra and computer graphics algorithms. In this layer, we working on how to associating appropriate geometry with data channels. For example, in the case to represent clusters of data, we need to associate size of cluster into area of circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphics layer** has a robust implementation of computer graphics algorithms and user interaction. The main objective of this layer is to produce geometry calculation from mapping layer into a displayable image on the computer screen. In the case of interactive visualization, we need to ensure that any given input processed correctly to produce expected effect on graphical representation of our data.\n",

    "## Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in mapping layer, the mapping process mainly focused on produce proper geometry primitive to the corresponding data channel. It is very important to know which best geometry to represent correspondent data. Failure in deciding best-suited geometry lead to the bad perception that will influence the quality of interpretation and conclusion.\n",
