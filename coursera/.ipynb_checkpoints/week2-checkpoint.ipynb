    "\n",
    "We can use [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) to visualize dan analyze data. Tableau has easy navigation, for example, we can easily found a \"Show More\" button to choose proper graph to visualize correspondent data.\n",

    "## Data Visualization Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a framework to help us and simplify our understanding of how data visualization work. The **data visualization framework** can be seen in an image below:\n",

    "<img src='data-visualization-framework.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Layer** contains two entities that are data sources and data collection. Before collecting all data, we need to do preprocessing that ensuring each data imported in the proper format. After data being imported, we need to ensure that all data stored in the best possible structure. In the case of a database, we can maintenance relation between data as database indexes, so will increase retrieval time. After data storing problem being solved, we can do such optimization to enhance our storage. By doing data analysis, we can decide the quality of data we have collected. The task of data analysis included: inspecting, cleansing, and transforming. The goal of data analysis is reduced noise in our data collection, by removing or transforming. Another crucial optimization is data aggregation which has a significant impact on retrieval performance of our data collection. The task of data aggregation included: classification, clustering, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mapping Layer** is a complicated layer which has robust implementation of linear algebra and computer graphics algorithms. In this layer, we working on how to associating appropriate geometry with data channels. For example, in the case to represent clusters of data, we need to associate size of cluster into area of circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphics layer** has a robust implementation of computer graphics algorithms and user interaction. The main objective of this layer is to produce geometry calculation from mapping layer into a displayable image on the computer screen. In the case of interactive visualization, we need to ensure that any given input processed correctly to produce expected effect on graphical representation of our data.\n",

    "## Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the mapping layer, the mapping process mainly focused on produce proper geometry primitive to the corresponding data channel. It is very important to know which best geometry to represent correspondent data. Failure in deciding best-suited geometry lead to bad perception that will influence the quality of interpretation and conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three group of geometry primitives classified by its dimensions:\n",

    "## Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization often consist very simple charts, but the success of data visualization can often depend on how we map our data to the elements of those charts. Here we discuss some of the simple charts and describe when we use each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bar chart\n",
    "    ![bar](bar.png \"Bar chart\")\n",

    "We can classify each type of chart by its characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "![when-use-charts](when-use-charts.png \"When use charts\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glyphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Glyphs is indicators that have shapes and colors to represent each kind of data point. An image below illustrated use of glyphs in various charts:\n",
    "\n",
    "![glyphs](glyphs-in-charts.png \"Glyphs in Charts\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we can use glyphs to show data attributes in the charts or other visualization. A very common practical example of using glyphs is visualizing standart deviation and variances in sample data as shown in image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![standart deviation](glyphs-standart-deviation.png \"Glyphs of standart deviation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Glyphs can be used in presentation visualization. Heatmap is an example presentation which used colorized glyphs on the map. Different group or individual might be not comfort with the Heatmap representation and demand for higher accuracy. We can used colorized glyphs as boxes with various hues in the table visualization. The y and x axes on the table chart discribe data variables and the glyphs help us to show the differences between data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Heatmap](heatmap.png \"Heatmap with colorized glyphs\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In some case, we might want to transform our visualization into more compact form. We may lost some details and accuary due transformation into compact form. For example, we may unable to plot detailed graph in each class of data due limited space. In that case, we doing a trade off between accuary and classification. An image below show that we can use glyphs to show differences of life ratio between continent with few detail about value of life ratio in each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Life Ratio](life-ratio.png \"Life ratio\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Glyphs can also represented as features with complex geometry. An image below is an example of glyphs that represent facial features:\n",

    "![Chernoff Faces](chernoff-faces.png \"Chernoff faces\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parallel Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel coordinates is a visualization technique to visualize high-dimensional data. The main objective of this technique is to reveal certain data features, such as collinearity, in high-dimensionality data. The main reason why we should used this technique is this technique can reduce visualization complexity due high-dimensionality of data. Below step-by-step how to construct parallel coordinates of n-dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two parallel lines of first two dimensions, for example x and y.\n",
    "2. Place each data into each parallel line based on its corresponding values. For example, points A(3, 2) and B(4, 3) should be placed at y(2, 3) and x(3, 4).\n",
    "3. Draw a lines between two parallel lines corresponding to each data points. For example, y(2, 3) and x(3, 4) should became two lines A(3 to 2) and B(4 to 3).\n",
    "4. Remove every glyph drawn in each parallel line, so there is just lines between parallel lines.\n",
    "5. Create one parallel line for next dimension, repeat step 2 until each dimension became a parallel line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below an example of parallel coordinates of four dimensional data:\n",

    "![Parallel coordinate](parallel-coordinate.png \"Parallel coordinate\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stacked Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacked graphs used when we want to represent accumulated data (multivariate in same axes). Below type of charts belong to stacked graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stacked bar chart\n",
    "* Relative stacked bar chart\n",
    "* Pie chart\n",
    "* Diverging stacked bar chart\n",
    "* Stacked line graph\n",
    "* Stacked graph layout\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, we need to carefully using stacked bar chart. We already know that position more accuary than length in representing quantitative data. Since stacked bar chart utilize position and length, we need to prioritize position representation over length. An image below illustrate how order of position is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stacking order](stacked-bar-chart1.png \"Stacking order\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacked bar chart might be not effective to represent huge accumulated data. For example, in visualizing multiple stock prices within long time interval, the stacked graph might be not effective to visualize price changes. To satisfy that condition, we need to transform stacked bar chart into stacked graph layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stacked graph layout](stacked-graph-layout.png \"Stacked graph layout\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to inspect area or distribution or testing the confidence interval, we may tranform stacked graph into Themeriver layout\n",
    "\n",
    "![Themeriver Layout](themeriver-layout.png \"Themeriver Layout\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do smoothing, if it possible to added some weight, then we may transfrom themeriver layout into streamgraph layout\n",
    "\n",
    "![Streamgraph layout](streamgraph-layout.png \"Streamgraph layout\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the case to prioritize position, we may do ordering\n",
